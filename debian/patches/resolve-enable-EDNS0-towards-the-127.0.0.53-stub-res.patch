Subject: [PATCH] resolve: enable EDNS0 towards the 127.0.0.53 stub resolver

This appears to be necessary for client software to ensure the reponse data
is validated with DNSSEC. For example, `ssh -v -o VerifyHostKeyDNS=yes -o
StrictHostKeyChecking=yes redpilllinpro01.ring.nlnog.net` fails if EDNS0 is
not enabled. The debugging output reveals that the `SSHFP` records were
found in DNS, but were considered insecure.

Note that the patch intentionally does *not* enable EDNS0 in the
`/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` file (the one that contains `nameserver`
entries for the upstream DNS servers), as it is impossible to know for
certain that all the upstream DNS servers handles EDNS0 correctly.
