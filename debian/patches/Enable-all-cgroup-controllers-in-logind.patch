Subject: Enable all cgroup controllers in logind

This changes the default logind configuration to enable all cgroup controllers.
Doing so will result in a /user/$UID.user/cX.session cgroup being created for
each of the listed controller with the cX.session entry belonging to the user.

In the event that one of the listed controllers doesn't exist under
/sys/fs/cgroup, logind will simply ignore it.  The list in this patch should be
kept up to date as new cgroup controllers are added to the kernel and the
distro (the config option unfortunately doesn't support wildcards).

This configuration is required, almongst other things by LXC for unprivileged
containers.
