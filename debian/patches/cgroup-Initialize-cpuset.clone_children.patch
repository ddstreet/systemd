Subject: cgroup: Initialize cpuset.clone_children

scope_start() calls cg_attach_many_everywhere() to move a unit's PIDs to all
supported cgroup controllers. However, that fails with ENOSPC for cpuset as
by default cpuset.{cpus,mems} are empty. Thus set cgroup.clone_children to 1 to
make the configuration of the root cgroup propagate to children. See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt for details.
