Subject: Dell system takes a long time to connect network with external dock

This is partially taken from:

provided by ChunKim, TeN cktenn@gmail.com

I adjusted that because the rule as-is would break the interface names
for existing users of the specific system/hardware, so instead it
only sets an ENV that is later checked by udevd after an interface
rename failure with EEXIST, to avoid the rename retries for 90 seconds.
