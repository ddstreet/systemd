Subject: UBUNTU: test/test-functions: drop all prefixes

When parsing and installing binaries mentioned in Exec*= lines the
5ed0dcf4d552271115d96d8d22b1a25494b85277 commit added parsing logic to drop
prefixes, including handling duplicate exclamation marks. But this did not
handle arbitrary combination of multiple prefixes, ie. StartExec=+-/bin/sh was
parsed as -/bin/sh which then would fail to install.

Instead of using egrep and shell replacements, replace both with sed command
that does it all. This sed script extract a group of characters starting with a
/ up to the first space (if any) after the equals sign. This correctly handles
existing non-prefixed, prefixed, multiple-prefixed commands.

About half commands seem to repeat themself, thus sort -u cuts the list of
binaries to install about in half.

To validate change of behaviour both old and new functions were modified to
echo parsed binaries into separate files, and then diffed. The incorrect
-/bin/sh was missing in the new output.

Without this patch tests fail on default Ubuntu installs.
