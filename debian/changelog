  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream release with merged udev+systemd code bases.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Split off new systemd-services binary package with logind, timedated,
    hostnamed, and localed. These can be used without the systemd init parts.
  * Add fallback to poweroff/reboot/pm-suspend/pm-hibernate if logind is
    running without systemd.
  * Clean up empty sessions when not running under systemd.
  * Add upstart job for logind.
  * Add Conflicts/Replaces/Provides for libpam-xdg-support and logind.
  * Disable udev and systemd packages for Ubuntu. udev (and its udebs) will be
    re-enabled once we apply our customizations from the standalone package,
    and the packages are confirmed to work. For systemd{,-sysv}, we need to
    decide whether or not we want these in universe.
  * Add epoch to libgudev packages for Ubuntu, as we had in udev.
