  * Merge packaging with current Debian unstable, to greatly reduce the diff
    noise. Ubuntu changes:
    Permanently Ubuntu specific:
    - debian/control, debian/rules, debian/systemd.install,
      debian/systemd-services.install: Split out systemd-services package with
      logind, timedated, hostnamed, and localed. Add
      libpam-systemd.systemd-logind.upstart to bring up logind at boot.
    - debian/rules: Don't build systemd and systemd-sysv packages, not
      approved for universe for now.
    - debian/udev.templates, Drop debconfiscation of udev, not necessary for
      Ubuntu.
    - debian/extra/initramfs.top: Drop $ROOTDELAY, we do that in a more
      sensible way with wait-for-root. (Will get applicable to Debian once
      Debian gets wait-for-root in initramfs-tools.)
    - Add debian/extra/rules/78-graphics-card.rules: Mark graphics devices as
      PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY so that we can wait for those in plymouth.
    - Drop debian/extra/{50-udev-default.rules,75-cd-aliases-generator.rules,
      80-networking.rules,91-permissions.rules}, we don't want these in
      Ubuntu.
    - Add debian/extra/udev.py: Apport hook.
    - debian/extra/udev.startup, debian/rules: Don't install/support
      /etc/udev/links.conf, that's a hack (if you want links, create udev
      rules).
    - Various debian/patches/*, see patch headers (unmergeable with Debian).
    - Drop debian/source/{git-patches,options}, we use proper patches.
    - debian/rules: We continue to use the old net iface naming schema for the
      time being. Install old udev rule generator in debian/udev.install.
      (Reconsider post-LTS)
    - debian/rules: Don't install init.d scripts, only the upstart jobs.
    - debian/rules: Add an epoch to libgudev.
    - Drop debian/udev.dirs, not necessary.
    - Drop debian/udev.NEWS, debian/udev.maintscript: Not applicable to
      Ubuntu.
    - debian/udev.{postinst,postrm,preinst,prerm}: Keep our much simpler
      versions (all platforms must support udev, no debconf).
    - debian/libgudev-1.0-0.install: Install into /lib/ (Debian has a patch
      for this to go into /usr/lib/).
    - debian/rules: Drop doc dir symlinking. It creates havoc with dpkg
      upgrades, and we already have the automatic per-file symlinking.

    Applicable to Debian:
    - debian/control, debian/tests/: Add autopkgtest.
    - debian/extra/initramfs.hook, debian/udev.*{pre,post}inst: Divert udevadm
      to udevadm.upgrade during upgrades while udev is unconfigured.
    - Add debian/extra/60-keyboard.hwdb: Latest upstream keymaps, for easy
      backporting.
    - debian/extra/initramfs.bottom: If LVM is installed, settle udev,
      otherwise we get missing LV symlinks. (LP #1185394)
    - debian/extra/rules/75-persistent-net-generator.rules: Add Ravello
      systems (LP #1099278)
    - Add debian/extra/README-{etc,lib}-rules.d documentation, install into
      udev.
    - debian/rules: Run tests during package build.
    - debian/udev.udev-finish.upstart: Fix path to tmp-rules,
      debian/extra/rule_generator.functions creates them in /run/udev/.
    - debian/udev.upstart: Fix path to udevd.
    - debian/shlibs.local: Drop libudev; this unnecessarily generates overly
      strict dependencies, and even wrong ones for our epoched libgudev.
    - debian/udev-udeb.install: Add 64-btrfs.rules and 75-probe_mtd.rules,
      they are potentially useful in a d-i environment.

    Will go away eventually:
    - Add debian/extra/rules/40-hyperv-hotadd.rules: Workaround for LP #1233466
    - Keep debian/extra/firmware.agent and rule in
      debian/extra/rules/80-drivers.rules until this has been tested to not be
      necessary under Ubuntu kernels any more.

    Upgrade fixes, keep until 14.04 LTS release:
    - debian/control: Conflicts/Replaces libpam-xdg-support.
    - debian/libpam-systemd.postinst: Trigger reboot notification for upgrade
      from < 204, due to changed cgroup layout.
    - debian/systemd-services.maintscript: Clean up obsolete
      /etc/init/systemd-logind.conf on upgrades.

  * Promote "systemd | systemd-shim" to Depends. (LP: #1221809)
  * 0000-upstream-hwdb-keyboard.patch: udev-builtin-keyboard: Fix large scan
    codes on 32 bit architectures. (side issue in LP #1247676)
  * Drop systemd init specific Debian patches which we don't need in Ubuntu;
    The Debian package does not track proper patches any more, so it doesn't
    help us keeping the patches around for merging.

  * Add preinst check to abort udev upgrade if the currently running kernel

  * Fix SysV init script to correctly mount a devtmpfs instead of tmpfs. This

    mounting the devtmpfs.  Closes: #722604
  * Drop pre-squeeze upgrade code from maintainer scripts and simplify the
    various upgrade checks.
  * Suppress errors about unknown hwdb builtin. udev 196 introduced a new
    "hwdb" builtin which is not understood by the old udev daemon.
  * Add missing udeb line to shlibs.local. This ensures that udev-udeb gets a
    proper dependency on libudev1-udeb and not libudev1.  Closes: #722939
  * Remove udev-udeb dependency from libudev1-udeb to avoid a circular
    dependency between the two packages. This dependency was copied over from
    the old udev-gtk-udeb package and no longer makes any sense since
    libudev1-udeb only contains a library nowadays.

systemd (204-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #675175, #675177
    - In v183 the udev sources have been merged into the systemd source tree.
      As a result, the udev binary packages will now be built from the systemd
      source package. To align the version numbers 139 releases were skipped.
    - For a complete list of changes, please refer to the NEWS file.
  * Add Marco to Uploaders.
  * Drop Suggests on the various python packages from systemd. The
    systemd-analyze tool has been reimplemented in C.
  * Add binary packages as found in the udev 175-7.2 source package.
  * Wrap dependencies for better readability.
  * Drop hard-coded Depends on libglib2.0-0 from gir1.2-gudev-1.0.
  * Drop old Conflicts, Replaces and Breaks, which are no longer necessary.
  * Make libgudev-1.0-dev depend on gir1.2-gudev-1.0 as per GObject
    introspection mini-policy.  Closes: #691313
  * The hwdb builtin has replaced pci-db and usb-db in udev. Drop the
    Recommends on pciutils and usbutils accordingly.
  * Drop our faketime hack. Upstream uses a custom xsl style sheet now to
    generate the man pages which no longer embeds the build date.
  * Add Depends on libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6) to libpam-systemd as we are
    using pam-auth-update.
  * Explicitly set Section and Priority for the udev binary package.
  * Update Build-Depends:
    - Drop libudev-dev, no longer required.
    - Add gtk-doc-tools and libglib2.0-doc for the API documentation in
      libudev and libgudev.
    - Add libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection for GObject
      introspection support in libgudev.
    - Add libgcrypt11-dev for encryption support in the journal.
    - Add libblkid-dev for the blkid udev builtin.
  * Use gir dh addon to ensure ${gir:Depends} is properly set.
  * Rename libudev0 → libudev1 for the SONAME bump.
  * Update symbols files. libudev now uses symbols versioning as the other
    libsystemd libraries. The libgudev-1.0-0 symbols file has been copied from
    the old udev package.
  * Run gtkdocize on autoreconf.
  * Enable python bindings for the systemd libraries and ship them in a new
    package named python-systemd.
  * Tighten Depends on libsystemd-id128-dev for libsystemd-journal-dev as per
    libsystemd-journal.pc.
  * Remove obsolete bash-completion scripts on upgrades. Nowadays they are
    installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.
  * Rename conffiles for logind and journald.
  * Rename udev-gtk-udeb → libudev1-udeb to better reflect its actual contents.
  * Build two flavours: a regular build and one for the udev udebs with
    reduced features/dependencies.
  * Create a few compat symlinks for the udev package, most notably
    /sbin/udevadm and /sbin/udevd.
  * Remove the dpkg-triggered debian-enable-units script. This was a temporary
    workaround for wheezy. Packages should use dh-systemd now to properly
    integrate service files with systemd.
  * Update debian/copyright using the machine-readable copyright format 1.0.
  * Integrate changes from udev 175-7 and acknowledge the 175-7.1 and 175-7.2
    non-maintainer uploads.
  * Keep the old persistent network interface naming scheme for now and make
    the new one opt-in via net.ifnames=1 on the kernel command line.
  * Drop the obsolete udev-mtab SysV init script and properly clean up on
    upgrades.
  * Simplify the udev SysV init script and remove experimental and obsolete
    features.
  * Revert upstream commits which dropped support for distro specific
    features and config files.
  * Make logind, hostnamed, localed and timedated D-Bus activatable and
    usable when systemd is not running.
  * Store hwdb binary database in /lib/udev, not /etc/udev. Create the file on
    install and upgrades.
  * Provide a dpkg file trigger for hwdb, so the database is automatically
    updated when packages install files into /lib/udev/hwdb.d.

    /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/mounts
  * Add breaks on lvm2 (<< 2.02.84-1) since older versions have udev rules
    that don't work well with systemd causing delays on bootup.

systemd (16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream release.  Closes: #609611
  * Get rid of now obsolete patches that are upstream.
  * Use the built-in cryptsetup support in systemd, build-depend on
    libcryptsetup-dev (>= 2:1.2.0-1) to get a libcryptsetup in /lib.
  * Don't use systemctl redirect for init scripts with X-Interactive: true

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Update package description
  * Use v8 debhelper syntax
  * Make single-user mode work
  * Run hwclock-save.service on shutdown
  * Remove dependencies on legacy sysv mount scripts, as we use native
    mounting.

systemd (15-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream version, thanks a lot to Michael Biebl for help with
    preparing this version.
    - This version handles cycle breaking better.  Closes: #609225
  * Add libaudit-dev to build-depends
  * /usr/share/systemd/session has been renamed to /usr/share/systemd/user
    upstream, adjust build system accordingly.
  * Remove -s from getty serial console invocation.
  * Add dependency on new util-linux to make sure /sbin/agetty exists
  * Don't mount /var/lock with gid=lock (Debian has no such group).
  * Document problem with ifupdown's /etc/network/run being a normal
    directory.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Revert upstream change which requires libnotify 0.7 (not yet available in
    Debian).
  * Use dh-autoreconf for updating the build system.
  * Revert upstream commit which uses fsck -l (needs a newer version of
    util-linux).
  * Explicitly disable cryptsetup support to not accidentally pick up a
    libcryptsetup dependency in a tainted build environment, as the library
    is currently installed in /usr/lib.
  * Remove autogenerated man pages and vala C sources, so they are rebuilt.
  * Use native systemd mount support:
    - Use MountAuto=yes and SwapAuto=yes (default) in system.conf
    - Mask SysV init mount, check and cleanup scripts.
    - Create an alias (symlink) for checkroot (→ remount-rootfs.service) as
      synchronization point for SysV init scripts.
  * Mask x11-common, rmnologin, hostname, bootmisc and bootlogd.
  * Create an alias for procps (→ systemd-sysctl.service) and
    urandom (→ systemd-random-seed-load.service).
  * Create an alias for module-init-tools (→ systemd-modules-load.service) and
    a symlink from /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf → /etc/modules.
  * Install lsb-base hook which redirects calls to SysV init scripts to
    systemctl: /etc/init.d/<foo> <action> → systemctl <action> <foo.service>
  * Install a (auto)mount unit to mount /lib/init/rw early during boot.

    in lockstep.  Thanks to Michael Biebl for the patch.
  * Add missing #DEBHELPER# token to libpam-systemd
  * Stop messing with runlevel5/multi-user.target symlink, this is handled
    correctly upstream.
  * Stop shipping /cgroup in the package.
  * Remove tmpwatch services, Debian doesn't have or use tmpwatch.
  * Make sure to enable GTK bits.
  * Ship password agent
  * Clean up cgroups properly on upgrades, thanks to Michael Biebl for the
    patch.  Closes: #599577
