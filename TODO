* udev-kernel.socket + udev.control.socket seems not
  to work, udevd is started but no fd is passed

F15:

* swap units that are activated by one name but shown in the kernel under another are semi-broken

F15 External:

* NFS, networkmanager ordering issue (PENDING)

* NM should pull in network.target (PENDING)
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692008

* bluetooth should be possible to disable (PENDING)

* get writev() /dev/kmsg support into the F15 kernel
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7e5b58bcbcb3d7518389c1d82fb6e926f5a9f72c

* make anaconda write timeout=0 for encrypted devices

* fix broken Sockets=syslog-ng.socket packaging

Features:
* possibly set timezone offset from systemd at init instead
  of calling hwclock

* kernel: add device_type = "fb", "fbcon" to class "graphics"

* verify that the AF_UNIX sockets of a service in the fs still exist
  when we start a service in order to avoid confusion when a user
  assumes starting a service is enough to make it accessible

* drop -lrt req for sd-daemon.[ch]

* Make it possible to set the keymap independently from the font on
  the kernel cmdline. Right now setting one resets also the other.

* add dbus call to convert snapshot into target

* move nss-myhostname into systemd

* figure out a standard place to configure timezone name, inform myllynen@redhat.com

* add dbus call to convert snapshot into target

* move /selinux to /sys/fs/selinux

* unset cgroup agents on shutdown

* add prefix match to sysctl, tmpfiles, ...

* send out "finished" signal when we are finished booting

* drop /.readahead on bigger upgrades with yum

* add inode stat() check to readahead to suppress preloading changed files

* allow list of paths in config_parse_condition_path()

* introduce dbus calls for enabling/disabling a service

* support notifications for services being enabled/disabled

* GC unreferenced jobs (such as .device jobs)

* support wildcard expansion in ListenStream= and friends

* support wildcard expansion in EnvironmentFile= and friends

* avoid DefaultStandardOutput=syslog to have any effect on StandardInput=socket services

* fix alsa mixer restore to not print error when no config is stored

* show enablement status in systemctl status

* when failing to start a service due to ratelimiting, try again later, if restart=always is set

* write blog stories about:
  - enabling dbus services
  - status update
  - /etc/sysconfig and /etc/default
  - how to write socket activated services

* maybe add tiny dbus services similar to hostnamed for locale and wallclock/timezone?

* allow port=0 in .socket units

* rename systemd-logger to systemd-stdio-syslog-bridge

* take BSD file lock on tty devices when using them?

* avoid any flag files, or readahead files in /, we need to support r/o /
  or / on tmpfs like Android setups.

* move readahead files into /var, look for them with .path units

* teach dbus to activate all services it finds in /etc/systemd/services/org-*.service

* get process transport into dbus for systemctl -P/-H

* document default dependencies

* support systemd.whitelist=/systemd.blacklist= on the kernel command
  line.

* Find a way to replace /var/run, /var/lock directories with
  symlinks during an RPM package upgrade (filesystem.rpm or systemd.rpm).
  (lua code to create symlinks right away for new installations is in filesytem.rpm now)
  We soon want to get rid of var-run.mount var-lock.mount units:
    if mountpoint /run ; then
          umount /var/run || :
    else
          mount --move /var/run /run || mount --bind /var/run /run
    fi
    mv /var/run /var/.run.save
    ln -s /run /var/run
    echo "R /var/.run.save" > /etc/tmpfiles.d/remove-run-save.conf

* when key file cannot be found, read it from kbd in cryptsetup

* add switch to systemctl to show enabled but not running services. Or
  another switch that shows service that have been running since
  booting but aren't running anymore.

* reuse mkdtemp namespace dirs in /tmp?

* recreate systemd's D-Bus private socket file on SIGUSR2

* be more specific what failed:
    ...
    Unmounting file systems.
    Not all file systems unmounted, 1 left.
    Disabling swaps.
    Detaching loop devices.
    Detaching DM devices.
    Cannot finalize remaining file systems and devices, trying to kill remaining processes.
    Unmounting file systems.
    Not all file systems unmounted, 1 left.
    Cannot finalize remaining file systems and devices, giving up.
    ...

* check for compiled-in, but not active selinux, and don't print any warnings
  about policy loading. Probably check for available selinux in /proc/filesystems,
  and check for active selinux with getcon_raw() == "kernel"

* Support --test based on current system state

* systemctl enable as D-Bus call

* consider services with any kind of link in /etc/systemd/system enabled

* show failure error string in "systemctl status"

* make sure timeouts are applied to Type=oneshot services.

* Implement:
    systemctl mask <unit>
    systemctl unmask <unit>
  Also support --temp to make this temporary by placing mask links in /run.

* detect LXC environment

* Maybe store in unit files whether a service should be enabled by default on package installation
  (belongs into a distro pattern though, not in an upstream package's service file)

* perhaps add "systemctl reenable" as combination of "systemctl disable" and "systemctl enable"

* need a way to apply mount options of api vfs from systemd unit files
  (or some other modern source?) instead of fstab?

* maybe introduce ExecRestartPre=

* figure out what happened to bluez patch

* Patch systemd-fsck to use -C and pass console fd to it

* configurable jitter for timer events

* Support ProcessNeededForShutdown=true to allow stuff like mdmon to
  be killed very late after the rootfs is read only? If implement pass
  this to shutdown binary via command line argument.

* use pivot_root on shutdown so that we can unmount the root directory.
   - copy binaries to, and pivot_root() to the "shutdown tmpfs"
   - solve "mdadm --wait-clean" problem that way

* dot output for --test showing the 'initial transaction'

* calendar time support in timer, iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)

* systemd --user
  - get PR_SET_ANCHOR merged: http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/2/165

* add VT tracking:
  - provide CK functionality
  - start getty only when actual vt switch happens (same model as
    socket on-demand activation). allocate the next free tty and
    start a getty there. this way, pressing alt-f[1-12] will switch
    through running X and getty sessions, and any unallocated
    activated tty will start a new getty. the hardcoding of
    getty[1-6] will entirely go away.

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:
   - uuidd    HAVEPATCH
   - rpcbind (/var/run/rpcbind.sock!) HAVEPATCH
   - cups     HAVEPATCH
   - postfix, saslauthd
   - apache/samba
   - libvirtd (/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro)
   - bluetoothd (/var/run/sdp! @/org/bluez/audio!)
   - distccd

* fingerprint.target, wireless.target, gps.target, netdevice.target

* set_put(), hashmap_put() return values check. i.e. == 0 doesn't free()!

* io priority during initialization

* if a service fails too often, make the service enter failed mode, and the socket, too.

* systemctl list-jobs - show dependencies

* auditd service files

* add systemctl switch to dump transaction without executing it

* suspend, resume support?

* readahead: btrfs/LVM SSD detection

* add separate man page for [Install] settings

* allow runtime changing of log level and target

* drop cap bounding set in readahead and other services

External:

* udisks should not use udisks-part-id, instead use blkid. also not probe /dev/loopxxx

* snd-seq should go, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=676095

* gnome-shell python script/glxinfo/is-accelerated must die

* make cryptsetup lower --iter-time

* patch kernel for xattr support in /dev, /proc/, /sys and /sys/fs/cgroup?

* patch kernel for cpu feature modalias for autoloading aes/kvm/...
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ak/linux-misc-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/cpuid-match
  (Rafael J. Wysocki's sysdev rework is on the way. After that CPUs can be exported a proper bus.)

* procps, psmisc, sysvinit-tools, hostname â†’ util-linux-ng

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)

* Use PR_SET_PROCTITLE_AREA if it becomes available in the kernel

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* pahole

* CFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--print-gc-sections -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections"
