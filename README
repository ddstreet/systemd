AUTHOR:
        Lennart Poettering with major support from Kay Sievers

REQUIREMENTS:
        Linux kernel >= 2.6.30 (with devtmpfs, cgroups; optional but strongly recommended: autofs4, ipv6)
        libudev >= 163
        dbus >= 1.4.0
        libcap
        gtk+ >= 2.20 (optional)
        PAM >= 1.1.2 (optional)
        libcryptsetup (optional)
        libaudit (optional)
        libselinux (optional)
        tcpwrappers (optional)
        libnotify (optional)

        When you build from git you need the following additional dependencies:

        vala >= 0.10
        docbook-xsl
        xsltproc
        automake
        autoconf
        libtool
        make, gcc, and similar tools

        During runtime you need the following dependencies:

        util-linux > v2.18 (requires fsck -l, agetty -s)
        sulogin (from sysvinit-tools, optional but recommended)
        plymouth (optional)
        dracut (optional)

WARNINGS:
        systemd will warn you during boot if /etc/mtab is not a
        symlink to /proc/mounts. Please ensure that /etc/mtab is a
        proper symlink.

        systemd will warn you during boot if /usr is on a different
        file system than /. While in systemd itself very little will
        break if /usr is on a seperate partition many of its
        dependencies very likely will break sooner or later in one
        form or another. For example udev rules tend to refer to
        binaries in /usr, binaries that link to libraries in /usr or
        binaries that refer to data files in /usr. Since these
        breakages are not always directly visible systemd will warn
        about this, since this kind of file system setup is not really
        supported anymore by the basic set of Linux OS components.
