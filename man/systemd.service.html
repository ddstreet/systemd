                specific to this unit type. See
                <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.unit</span>(5)</span>
                for the common options of all unit configuration
                files. The common configuration items are configured
                in the generic <code class="literal">[Unit]</code> and
                <code class="literal">[Install]</code> sections. The service
                specific configuration options are configured in the
                <code class="literal">[Service]</code> section.</p><p>Additional options are listed in
                <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.exec</span>(5)</span>,
                which define the execution environment the commands
                are executed in.</p><p>Unless <code class="varname">DefaultDependencies=</code>
                is set to <code class="option">false</code>, service units will
                implicitly have dependencies of type
                <code class="varname">Requires=</code> and
                <code class="varname">After=</code> on
                <code class="filename">basic.target</code> as well as
                dependencies of type <code class="varname">Conflicts=</code> and
                <code class="varname">Before=</code> on
                <code class="filename">shutdown.target</code>. These ensure
                that normal service units pull in basic system
                initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to
                system shutdown. Only services involved with early
                boot or late system shutdown should disable this
                option.</p><p>If a service is requested under a certain name
                but no unit configuration file is found, systemd looks
                for a SysV init script by the same name (with the
                <code class="filename">.service</code> suffix removed) and
                dynamically creates a service unit from that
                script. This is useful for compatibility with
                SysV.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Options"><a id="id434701"/><h2>Options</h2><p>Service files must include a
