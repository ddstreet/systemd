                about a process controlled and supervised by
                systemd.</p><p>This man page lists the configuration options
                specific to this unit type. See

                for the common options of all unit configuration
                files. The common configuration items are configured
                in the generic <code class="literal">[Unit]</code> and
                <code class="literal">[Install]</code> sections. The service
                specific configuration options are configured in the
                <code class="literal">[Service]</code> section.</p><p>Additional options are listed in
                <a href="systemd.exec.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.exec</span>(5)</span></a>,
                which define the execution environment the commands
                are executed in, and in
                <a href="systemd.kill.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">systemd.kill</span>(5)</span></a>
                which define the way the processes of the service are
                terminated.</p><p>Unless <code class="varname">DefaultDependencies=</code>
                is set to <code class="option">false</code>, service units will
                implicitly have dependencies of type
                <code class="varname">Requires=</code> and
                <code class="varname">After=</code> on
                <code class="filename">basic.target</code> as well as
                dependencies of type <code class="varname">Conflicts=</code> and
                <code class="varname">Before=</code> on
                <code class="filename">shutdown.target</code>. These ensure
                that normal service units pull in basic system
                initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to
                system shutdown. Only services involved with early
                boot or late system shutdown should disable this
                option.</p><p>If a service is requested under a certain name
                but no unit configuration file is found, systemd looks
                for a SysV init script by the same name (with the
                <code class="filename">.service</code> suffix removed) and
                dynamically creates a service unit from that
                script. This is useful for compatibility with
                SysV. Note that this compatibility is quite
                comprehensive but not 100%. For details about the
                incompatibilities see the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Incompatibilities" target="_top">Incompatibilities
                with SysV</a> document.

                                as part of its start-up. The parent process is
                                expected to exit when start-up is

                                traditional UNIX daemons. If this

                                expected that the daemon acquires a
                                name on the D-Bus bus, as configured
                                by

                                specified.</p><p>Behavior of

                                expected that the daemon sends a

                                starting up. systemd will proceed
                                starting follow-up units after this
                                notification message has been sent. If
                                this option is used
