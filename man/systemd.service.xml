                                        <para>If set to
                                        <literal>forking</literal>
                                        (the default) it is expected
                                        that the process configured
                                        with
                                        <varname>ExecStart=</varname>
                                        will start up and call
                                        <function>fork()</function>. The
                                        parent process is expected to
                                        finish when start-up is
                                        complete and all communication
                                        channels set up. The child
                                        continues to run as the main
                                        daemon process. This is the
                                        behaviour of traditional UNIX
                                        daemons. If this setting is
                                        used it is recommended to also
                                        use the
                                        <varname>PIDFile=</varname>
                                        option, so that systemd can
                                        identify the main process of
                                        the daemon. systemd will start
                                        follow-up units as soon as the
                                        parent process exited.</para>

                                        <para>If set to
                                        <literal>simple</literal> (the
                                        recommended value) it is
                                        expected that the process
                                        configured with
                                        <varname>ExecStart=</varname>
                                        is the main process of the
                                        daemon. In this mode
                                        communication channels must be
                                        available before the daemon is
                                        started up, as systemd will
                                        immediately start follow-up
                                        units.</para>

                                        similar to

                                        however it is expected that
                                        the process has to exit before
                                        systemd starts follow-up
                                        units. <varname>ValidNoProcess=</varname>
                                        is particularly useful for
                                        this type of service.</para>

                                        however it is expected that

                                        the D-Bus bus, as configured
                                        by
                                        <varname>BusName=</varname>. Follow-up
                                        units will be started after
                                        the name has been
